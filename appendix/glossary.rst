    3'
        Refers to the third carbon of the nucleic acid sugar moiety to which
        additional nucleotides may be added by polymerase, often used to refer
        to that end of a single-stranded DNA or RNA molecule where the 3' carbon
        is unattached to an adjacent nucleotide; cf. 5'.

    5'
        Refers to the fifth carbon of the nucleic acid sugar moiety, to which
        the triphosphate is attached in a nucleotide triphosphate, often used to
        refer to that end of a single-stranded DNA or RNA molecule where the 5'
        carbon's phosphate group is unattached to an adjacent nucleotide; cf.
        3'.

    alternative splicing
        The inclusion or exclusion of certain exons in the splicing reactions
        that determine the sequences included in the final mRNA product. This
        mechanism is utilized to generate a series of closely related protein
        isoforms, which differ by the inclusion or exclusion of the particular
        protein domains encoded by those exons. Alternative splicing is directed
        by RNA-binding proteins that block, or stimulate, utilization of a
        particular splice site.

    amino acid
        The basic building block of proteins, a small molecule with a -C-C-
        core, an amino group at one end and a carboxylic acid group at the other
        end. The basic structure can be represented as NH2-CHR-COOH, where R can
        be any of 20 different moieties, including acidic, basic, or hydrophobic
        groups.

    annotation
        Gene annotation is the process of indicating the location, structure,
        and identity of genes in a genome. As this may be based on incomplete
        information, gene annotations are constantly changing with improved
        knowledge. Gene annotation databases change regularly, and different
        databases may refer to the same gene/protein by different names,
        reflecting a changing understanding of protein function.

    antisense strand
        Also called the negative, template, or non-coding strand. This strand of
        the DNA sequence of a single gene is the complement of the 5' to 3' DNA
        strand known as the sense, positive, non-template, or coding strand. The
        term loses meaning for longer DNA sequences with genes on both strands.

    base
        Although formally incorrect (the nitrogenous base which gives each
        nucleotide its name is only part of the nucleotide), this is often used
        as a synonym for "nucleotide."

    base pair (base pairing)
        The hydrogen bonding of one of the bases (A, C, G, T, U) with another,
        as dictated by the optimization of hydrogen bond formation in DNA (A-T
        and C-G) or in RNA (A-U and C-G). Two polynucleotide strands, or regions
        thereof, in which all the nucleotides form such base pairs are said to
        be complementary. In achieving complementarity, each strand of DNA can
        serve as a template for synthesis of its partner strand- the secret of
        DNA replication's extremely high accuracy and thereby of inheritance.

    cDNA
        "complementary DNA," a double-stranded DNA molecule prepared in vitro by
        copying an RNA molecule back into DNA using reverse transcriptase. The
        RNA component of the resulting RNA-DNA hybrid is then destroyed by
        alkali, and the complementary strand to the remaining DNA strand
        synthesized by DNA polymerase. The resulting double-stranded DNA can be
        used for cloning and analysis.

    CDS
        "Coding sequence", that part of the DNA sequence of a gene which is
        translated into protein.

    coding exon
        In a gene, any exon which contains some part of the CDS; in contrast, an
        exon which has no part translated into protein is called a "non-coding
        exon."

    coding strand
        In a gene, the DNA strand that has the sequence found in the RNA
        molecule. Also called the sense, positive, or non-template strand.

    codon
        The sequence of three nucleotides in DNA or RNA that specifies a
        particular amino acid.

    coordinates
        Numerical position within a biological sequence, e.g. the first base in
        a DNA sequence would have the coordinate 1.

    exon
        An exon is a contiguous segment of eukaryotic DNA that corresponds to a
        portion of the mature (processed) RNA product of that gene. Exons are
        found only in eukaryotic genomes, and are separated by introns. Although
        the introns are transcribed with the exons, the latter are spliced out
        and discarded during RNA processing.

    frame
        A frame is a single series of adjacent nucleotide triplets in DNA or
        RNA: one frame would have bases at positions 1, 4, 7, etc. as the first
        base of sequential codons.

        There are 3 possible reading frames in an mRNA strand and six in a
        double stranded DNA molecule due to the two strands from which
        transcription is possible. Different computer programs number these
        frames differently, particularly for frames of the negative strand, so
        care should be taken when comparing designated frames from different
        programs.

    initiation codon (start codon)
        The first codon of a coding sequence. In eukaryotes this is almost
        always ATG, which codes for Methionine.

    intron
        Non-coding sections of a eukaryotic nucleic acid sequence found between
        exons. Introns are removed ("spliced out") of mRNA after transcription
        and before the molecule is exported to the cytoplasm for translation;
        cf. exon.

    isoform
        Alternate forms of a gene that are produced by alternative splicing of a
        particular mRNA, or different transcription start sites. Isoforms of a
        gene always have different mRNA sequences, but they may have the same
        protein sequence.

    mature mRNA
        Messenger RNA that has been completely processed; it has a
        7-methylguanosine cap at its 5' end, a poly (A) tail at its 3' end, and
        has all its introns spliced out.

    non-coding strand
        Also called the negative, template, or anti-sense strand. This strand of
        the DNA sequence of a single gene is the complement of the 5' to 3' DNA
        strand known as the sense, positive, non-template, or coding strand. The
        term loses meaning for longer DNA sequences with genes on both strands.

    ORF
        "Open Reading Frame", a long stretch of codons in the same reading frame
        uninterrupted by stop codons; an ORF may reflect the presence of a gene.

    phase
        The phase describes the number of bases between the end of the exon
        (defined by the splice site) and the full codon nearest that splice
        site. The number of bases between the adjacent full codon and an
        exon/splice site can be either 0, 1 or 2. The phase of an upstream exon
        will determine which frame is translated in the downstream exon as it
        will indicate how many bases are used after the acceptor splice site to
        create a full codon of 3 bases.

    poly(A) tail
        About 250 nucleotides of adenylate residues that are
        post-transcriptionally added by poly (A) polymerase to the 3' end of
        eukaryotic mRNA following cleavage of the newly synthesized RNA about 20
        nucleotides downstream of an AAUAAA signal sequence.

    pre-mRNA
        The initial transcript from a protein-coding gene is often called a
        pre-mRNA and contains both introns and exons. Pre-mRNA requires the
        addition of a 5' cap and 3' poly (A) tail and the removal of introns to
        produce the final mRNA molecule containing only exons.

    promoter
        A segment of DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription
        of the downstream gene(s).

    read
        A raw DNA sequence.

    splicing
        The process by which introns are removed and exons are joined to produce
        a mature, functional RNA from a primary transcript. Some RNAs are
        self-splicing, but most require a specific ribonucleoprotein complex to
        catalyze the reaction.

    splice acceptor site
        The boundary between an intron and the exon immediately downstream
        (i.e., on the 3' side of the intron).

    splice donor site
        The boundary between an intron and the exon immediately upstream (i.e.,
        on the 5' side of the intron).

    splice junction
        Either a splice acceptor site or a splice donor site.

    stop codon (termination codon)
        A codon that specifies the termination of peptide synthesis; sometimes
        called "nonsense codons," since they do not specify any amino acid.

    transcription
        The process of copying one strand of a DNA double helix by RNA
        polymerase, creating a complimentary strand of RNA called the
        transcript.

    translation
        The process by which codons in an mRNA are used by the ribosome to
        direct protein synthesis.

    UTR
        "Untranslated region", a segment of DNA (or RNA) which is transcribed
        and present in the mature mRNA, but not translated into protein. UTRs
        may occur at either or both the 5' and 3' ends of a gene or transcript.
