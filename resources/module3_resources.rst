Lesson Plan
-------------------------------

Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Transcription Part II: What happens to the initial (pre-mRNA)
  transcript made by RNA pol II?


Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Explain how the transcript generated by RNA polymerase II (the
  pre-mRNA) is processed to become mature mRNA, using the sequence
  signals identified in :ref:`module2/module2_exercise:Module 2`.

- Use the genome browser to analyze the relationships among:

  .. cssclass:: compact-list

     1. pre-mRNA
     2. 5' capping
     3. 3' polyadenylation
     4. Splicing
     5. mRNA


Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`module1/module1_exercise:Module 1` and
  :ref:`module2/module2_exercise:Module 2`

- Define pre-mRNA as the RNA that results from the process of
  transcription; this initial transcript includes exons and introns


Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Warm Up Discussion

- Investigation


Homework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None


Class Instruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Discuss the question:  What happens to the initial (pre-mRNA)
  transcript made by RNA pol II?  Does it leave the nucleus "as is"?  Or
  do changes have to occur?  (Hint: introns vs. exons) (Discuss with a
  partner then as a class).

- Mini-presentation illustrating that during pre-mRNA processing,
  three events occur:

  .. cssclass:: compact-list

     1. 5' capping
     2. 3' polyadenylation
     3. Splicing out of introns


- Work through the genome browser investigation, with pauses to
  discuss the answers to the questions.

- Conclude with emphasis on main points

- Pre-mRNA is processed using 3 steps:

  .. cssclass:: compact-list

     1. 5' capping
     2. 3' polyadenylation
     3. Removal of introns through splicing (via spliceosome)
