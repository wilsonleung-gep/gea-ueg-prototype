Module 2 Instructor Resources
===============================

Lesson Plan
-------------------------------

Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Transcription Part I: From DNA sequence to transcription unit


Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Describe how a primary transcript (pre-mRNA) can be synthesized
  using a DNA molecule as the template.

- Explain the importance of the 5' and 3' regions of the gene for
  initiation and termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II

- Identify the beginning and end of a transcript using the
  capabilities of the genome browser (RNA-Seq, Short Match)


Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Structure of a gene (:ref:`module1/module1_exercise:Module 1`)


Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Describe regulatory signals: Transcription Start Site (TSS), and
  AATAAA sequence (site of transcript cleavage for termination)

- Investigation 1: Students find the transcript for tra-RA using the
  genome browser and identify the transcription unit

- Investigation 2: Students map the 5' end of the transcript

- Investigation 3: Students map the 3' end of the transcript

- Review pairing of DNA bases



Homework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None


Class Instruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Discuss the questions: What is transcription? What cellular proteins
  are required for transcription? How does it work mechanistically? What
  is/are the products of transcription? (students discuss in pairs, then
  as a class)

- Work through the genome browser investigation, then identify where
  transcription starts and ends for the *tra* gene. How long is the
  pre-mRNA?

- Conclude by challenging students to think about these questions:

  - How important is it for RNA polymerase II to recognize the
    promoter sequence?

  - Do you think it is possible for a gene to have more than one
    transcription start site? How would RNA polymerase II know which one
    to choose? When would it make a difference in the protein product,
    and when not?
